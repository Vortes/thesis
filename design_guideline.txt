Version: 1.0
Core Aesthetic: Cozy Retro-Futurism / "Game Boy Color Desk"
Philosophy: Tactile, Low-Resolution, Nostalgic, Slow-Tech.

1. Visual Language Overview

The interface mimics a physical desktop viewed through a low-resolution pixelated screen (reminiscent of 90s handheld consoles). It avoids modern "flat design" trends in favor of:

Skeuomorphism: Digital items look like physical objects (paper, folders, cassettes).

Hard Edges: No soft rounded corners (unless pixelated).

Chunky UI: Large buttons, thick borders, and high-contrast elements.

2. Color Palette

A. The Desk Environment (Structural)

These colors define the "physical" world of the app (the desk, the organizer, the shadows).

Dark Wood (Primary UI Borders/Sidebar): #8b7355

Light Wood (Main Containers): #a08560

Deep Shadow (Recessed areas/Text on wood): #5e4c35

Leather/Pouch (Toolkits): #4a3b2a

B. Paper & Surfaces (Content)

Used for areas where users read or write.

Crisp Paper (Letters): #fdfbf7

Aged Folder (Sidebar/Headers): #e0d5c1

Map/Background: #e5e7eb (Cool Grey)

Archive Paper (History): #f0e6d2

C. Functional Accents

Terminal Green (Success/Active/Open): #a3e635

Alert Red (Action/Ready/Record): #ef4444

Tech Blue (Information/Connecting): #60a5fa

Ink Black (Borders/Text): #2d2d2d (Avoid pure #000000 for text)

3. Typography

The app uses a strict two-font system to distinguish between "System UI" and "User Content".

Primary: System UI

Font: Press Start 2P (Google Fonts)

Usage: Buttons, Tab Labels, Status Indicators, Tooltips.

Styling Rules:

Almost always UPPERCASE.

Small sizes (8px - 12px).

Letter spacing should be slightly wide (tracking-widest in Tailwind).

Secondary: User Content

Font: VT323 (Google Fonts)

Usage: Letter body text, Logs, Descriptions, Dialogue.

Styling Rules:

Mixed case allowed.

Large sizes (text-xl to text-3xl) to mimic low-resolution screen legibility.

Simulates a typewriter or terminal output.

4. Component Styling Rules

A. The "Pixel Border"

CRITICAL: Do not use standard CSS borders (e.g., border: 2px solid black). They look too "web-like".
Instead, use box-shadow to create hard, non-aliased pixel edges.

Class: .pixel-border

box-shadow: 
  -4px 0 0 0 black,
  4px 0 0 0 black,
  0 -4px 0 0 black,
  0 4px 0 0 black;


Class: .pixel-border-sm (For smaller buttons/items)

box-shadow: 
  -2px 0 0 0 black,
  2px 0 0 0 black,
  0 -2px 0 0 black,
  0 2px 0 0 black;


B. Buttons

Base: High contrast background (e.g., #fdfbf7 or #ef4444).

Border: Always use .pixel-border-sm.

Interaction:

Hover: Shift background brightness or inverse colors.

Active: Physical displacement using translate-y.

Disabled: Reduce opacity to 0.5 and change cursor to not-allowed.

C. Modals & Overlays

Backdrop: bg-black/60 with backdrop-blur-sm.

Container: Must look like a physical device (e.g., A grey plastic Cassette Player, a tan Sketchpad).

Close Button: Always a Red square with a white 'X' in the top-right corner, protruding slightly from the frame.

5. Animation Library

Animations should feel mechanical and "sprite-based", not fluid or elastic.

animate-float: Slow up/down bobbing for floating UI elements or characters.

animate-bounce-sm: Short, snappy vertical bounce for alerts (Exclamation marks).

animate-pulse-ring: Expanding ripple effect for map pins.

animate-walk: 4-step rotation/waddle for characters.

@keyframes walk {
  0% { transform: translateY(0); }
  25% { transform: translateY(-1px) rotate(2deg); }
  50% { transform: translateY(0); }
  75% { transform: translateY(-1px) rotate(-2deg); }
  100% { transform: translateY(0); }
}


6. Iconography & Assets

A. Icons

Library: lucide-react.

Style: Stroke width 2px (to match pixel borders).

Color: Usually Dark Charcoal (#2d2d2d) or matching the text color.

B. Characters (PixelCritter)

Technology: Inline SVG.

Grid: Based on a 24x24 pixel grid.

Poses:

Happy: Arms raised (v), eyes open.

Walk: Legs offset, slight rotation.

Sleep: Flattened body (__), eyes closed (- -), Zzz particles.

7. Layout Patterns

A. The "Drawer" Pattern (Evidence Bag)

Avoid sidebars for secondary content. Use a bottom drawer that mimics a physical object sliding into view.

Closed: Shows a summary tab (handle).

Open: Slides up (translateY(0)) to reveal content.

B. The "Paper Texture" Pattern

For reading surfaces, apply a subtle CSS pattern to mimic dot-matrix paper or lined stationery.

.paper-texture {
  background-color: #fdfbf7;
  background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(transparent, transparent 31px, #e5e7eb 31px, #e5e7eb 32px);
  background-attachment: local;
}


C. The "Map" Pattern

For the dashboard background, use a grid pattern to simulate a digital map surface.

.map-pattern {
  background-color: #e5e7eb;
  background-image: 
    linear-gradient(#fff 2px, transparent 2px),
    linear-gradient(90deg, #fff 2px, transparent 2px);
  background-size: 40px 40px;
}
